This repo is for Comp 20 - Web Programming - at Tufts University.

My favorite project was the personal site (assignment 1) because I couldn't figure out assignment 3, and 4 wasn't necessarily aligned with my interests.

I'm proud of what I learned in assignment 4 even though it still didn't work properly in the end. 

I think I have learned a LOT this semester but I could have learned more if I spent more time on the class, so I definitely want to make sure that I keep learning web dev.
